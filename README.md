  <h1>The WeatherGenerator <br> Machine Learning Earth System Model</h1>
</div>

The WeatherGenerator project is developing a machine learning-based Earth system model. 
It will be trained on a wide range of datasets, including reanalyses, forecast data and observations, to provide a robust and versatile model for the dynamics.
Through this, it can be used for a wide-range of applications. General updates are shared on the project website: [weathergenerator.eu](https://weathergenerator.eu/) 

More details coming soon. Please open an issue if you are interested in using the model.

# How to use the WeatherGenerator project

The model is currently being developed by the WeatherGenerator Consortium. If you want to
engage, you are encouraged to contact us first by opening an issue on Github.

# Development guidelines

The [main branch](https://github.com/ecmwf/WeatherGenerator/tree/main) is the most stable version. If you are running experiments, you should use this branch.

The [develop branch](https://github.com/ecmwf/WeatherGenerator/tree/develop) has the latest
features. However, it is currently evolving at a fast pace. It should not be expected to have stable code or weight interfaces, or to be backward compatible.
